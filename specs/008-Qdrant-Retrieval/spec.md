## Project Name
Semantic Data Retrieval from Qdrant Using Cohere Embeddings

## Purpose
Provide a tool to retrieve semantically relevant text from a Qdrant collection using embeddings generated by Cohere’s API.

## Inputs
- Query text string provided by the user.
- Environment variables:
  - `COHERE_API_KEY` – API key for Cohere embeddings
  - `QDRANT_URL` – Qdrant cloud URL
  - `QDRANT_API_KEY` – API key for Qdrant
  - `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME` – Name of the Qdrant collection

## Outputs
- List of text results (payloads) from Qdrant matching the query semantically.
- Returned as a list from the `retrieve_data` function.

## Functional Requirements
1. Connect to Cohere API and Qdrant using environment variables.  
2. Generate embeddings for the input query using Cohere `embed-english-v3.0`.  
3. Query the Qdrant collection with the embedding to find the top 5 closest points.  
4. Extract and return the `text` field from the payload of the returned points.  
5. Provide a `function_tool`-decorated `retrieve_data` function that can be called as a tool in agents.  

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Use secure storage for API keys (`.env` file).  
- Embeddings must be consistent with the dimensionality of the Qdrant collection.  
- Return results efficiently with minimal latency.  

## Constraints
- Cohere embeddings must match the Qdrant collection vector size.  
- Only top 5 results are returned per query.
