title: "Chapter 3 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)"
description: "Full academic chapter explaining digital twin concepts, physics simulation, environment building, sensor simulation, Gazebo and Unity usage, and visualization for humanoid robotics."

version: "1.0"

## User Story
As an author, I want SpecifyPlus to generate Chapter 3 of the textbook with deep explanations of Digital Twin concepts, physics-based simulation, virtual environments, Gazebo and Unity workflows, sensor simulation, and humanoid robot visualization.

## Requirements
### Functional
1. Provide 8–12 detailed sections explaining:
   - What Digital Twins are and their relevance in robotics
   - Physics simulation fundamentals: gravity, collisions, friction, and rigid body dynamics
   - Gazebo simulation environment setup and configuration
   - Robot description formats: URDF & SDF
   - Sensor simulation for humanoids (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)
   - Unity environment creation for high-fidelity rendering and interaction
   - Human-robot interaction visualization
   - Sim-to-real considerations and best practices
2. Include tables comparing tools, physics engines, sensor capabilities, and simulation pipelines.
3. Include ASCII diagrams for:
   - Physics simulation loops
   - Sensor-data pipelines
   - Virtual environment architecture
4. Provide weekly learning outcomes for Weeks 6–7.
5. Output must be Docusaurus-ready Markdown.

### Non-Functional
- Clear academic style suitable for advanced robotics students.
- All sections must be fully written; no placeholders.
- Include diagrams, tables, and callouts as needed.

### Success Criteria
- spec.md fully describes every section of Chapter 3.
- Ready for /sp.plan and /sp.implement.
- Covers all key aspects of digital twin concepts, Gazebo, Unity, sensor simulation, and humanoid visualization.
