   - What Physical AI is
   - Embodiment
   - Sensorimotor intelligence
   - Physics-aware reasoning
   - Humanoid sensors
   - Robotic control loops
   - Modern humanoid robots (Optimus, Figure 01, Unitree G1, etc.)
2. Include tables, diagrams, callouts, robotics terminology lists.
3. Include ASCII diagrams for perception → planning → actuation loops.
4. Provide weekly learning outcomes for Weeks 1–2.
5. Output must be Docusaurus-ready Markdown.
