# Terminology

## Glossary of Robotics and Physical AI Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout this chapter and foundational concepts in robotics and physical AI. Understanding these terms is essential for grasping the complexities of embodied intelligence and robotic systems.

*   **Actuator**: A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system, for example, by converting electrical energy into mechanical force.
*   **Affordance**: The possibilities for action offered by an object or environment to an agent. In robotics, understanding affordances allows a robot to know how to interact with an object (e.g., a handle affords grasping).
*   **Algorithm**: A set of rules or instructions that a computer uses to solve a problem or perform a task.
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.
*   **Autonomy**: The ability of a robot to perform tasks without continuous human guidance, making independent decisions within its operational parameters.
*   **Bipedal Locomotion**: The ability to move using two legs, as seen in humanoids.
*   **Center of Mass (CoM)**: The unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero. Crucial for understanding balance and stability in robots.
*   **Closed-Loop Control**: A control system that uses feedback from the system to adjust its output. The sensorimotor loop is an example.
*   **Cognitive Embodiment**: The concept that an agent's cognitive processes are shaped by its physical body and interactions with the environment.
*   **Computer Vision**: A field of AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images and videos.
*   **Control System**: A device or set of devices that manages, commands, directs, or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems.
*   **Degrees of Freedom (DoF)**: The number of independent parameters that define the configuration of a mechanical system (e.g., number of joints in a robotic arm).
*   **Dexterity**: The ability to perform complex movements and manipulations with skill and precision, especially with the hands.
*   **Digital AI**: AI systems that operate purely in digital or simulated environments, processing abstract data without direct physical interaction.
*   **Dynamic Balance**: The ability to maintain equilibrium while in motion, continuously adjusting the center of mass.
*   **Embodiment**: The state of having a physical body through which an intelligent agent experiences and interacts with the world.
*   **Encoder**: A sensor that converts angular position or motion into an analog or digital code, used to measure joint angles in robots.
*   **End-Effector**: The device or tool located at the end of a robotic arm, designed to interact with the environment (e.g., gripper, hand, tool).
*   **Feedback Control**: See Closed-Loop Control.
*   **Force/Torque (F/T) Sensor**: A sensor that measures forces and torques applied at a specific point, often used at robot wrists or ankles.
*   **Friction**: The force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces, fluid layers, or material elements in contact.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study of interactions between humans and robots, focusing on designing robots that can interact effectively and naturally with people.
*   **Humanoid Robot**: A robot designed to resemble the human body, typically with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs.
*   **Inertia**: The property of matter by which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line, unless that state is changed by an external force.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**: An electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the orientation of the body, using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes.
*   **Inverse Kinematics (IK)**: The mathematical process of calculating the joint parameters (angles) of a robot manipulator to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end-effector.
*   **Kinematics**: The study of motion without considering the forces that cause the motion. Describes the relationship between joint angles and end-effector position/orientation.
*   **Latency**: The delay between the cause and effect in a system, critical in real-time robotic control.
*   **LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)**: A remote sensing method that uses pulsed laser to measure distances and create precise 3D maps of the environment.
*   **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming, often used for perception and decision-making in robots.
*   **Motor Control**: The process by which humans and animals use their brains to activate and coordinate the muscles and limbs involved in the performance of a motor skill.
*   **Navigation**: The process by which a robot determines its current position and plans a path to a target destination.
*   **Open-Loop Control**: A control system where the output is determined solely by the input, without feedback from the system's state.
*   **Perception**: The process of acquiring, interpreting, and understanding sensory information about the environment.
*   **Perception-Planning-Action (PPA) Loop**: The fundamental cycle of intelligent embodied systems, involving continuous perception, internal world modeling, action planning, control, and physical actuation.
*   **Physical AI**: AI systems that are embodied in physical forms, allowing them to interact directly with the real world through sensors and actuators.
*   **Physics-Aware Reasoning**: The ability of an AI system to understand and apply physical laws to predict and guide its interactions with the physical world.
*   **PID Controller**: Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller, a widely used feedback control loop mechanism.
*   **Planning**: The process of determining a sequence of actions for a robot to achieve a specific goal.
*   **Proprioception**: The sense of the relative position of neighboring parts of the body and strength of effort being employed in movement. Internal sensors (e.g., encoders, IMUs) provide this in robots.
*   **Real-time Operating System (RTOS)**: An operating system intended for real-time applications, ensuring predictable and deterministic execution of critical tasks.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.
*   **Robotics**: The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots.
*   **Sensor Fusion**: The process of combining data from multiple sensors to obtain a more accurate, complete, or reliable understanding of the environment or system state.
*   **Sensorimotor Intelligence**: The ability to acquire knowledge and interact with the environment through the integration of sensory inputs and motor actions.
*   **Sim-to-Real Gap**: The challenge of transferring policies or skills learned in a simulated environment to a real-world robot due to discrepancies between simulation and reality.
*   **State Estimation**: The process of inferring the current state (e.g., position, velocity, orientation) of a robot from noisy sensor data.
*   **Support Polygon**: The area on the ground defined by a robot's contact points with the surface; crucial for maintaining balance.
*   **Tactile Sensor**: A sensor that detects physical contact, pressure, or other tactile properties.
*   **Torque**: A twisting force that tends to cause rotation.
*   **World Model**: An internal representation maintained by a robot about its environment, including objects, their properties, and the robot's own position within that environment.
