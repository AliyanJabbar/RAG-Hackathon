# Chapter 1: Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

## Overview

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence. We will explore how physical robots interact with the real world, the importance of sensorimotor intelligence, and the role of physics-aware reasoning in enabling advanced robotic behaviors. The chapter also delves into the various sensors humanoids use, the control loops that govern their actions, and profiles some of the most advanced modern humanoids. Finally, we will define key terminology and outline the learning objectives for this module.

## Learning Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the key topics covered in Chapter 1, designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and Embodied Intelligence.

-   **What is Physical AI?**: Delve into the core definitions and differentiate Physical AI from its digital counterparts.
-   **Embodiment**: Understand the concept of embodiment in AI and robotics, drawing parallels with biological systems.
-   **Sensorimotor Intelligence**: Explore how robots perceive their environment and act upon it through integrated sensoraction loops.
-   **Physics-Aware Reasoning**: Learn why understanding physics is crucial for robots to interact with the physical world effectively.
-   **Humanoid Sensors**: Discover the array of sensors used by humanoids, from cameras to force-feedback systems.
-   **Robotic Control Loops**: Examine the fundamental control mechanisms that enable precise and responsive robotic movements.
-   **Modern Humanoids**: Get acquainted with leading examples of advanced humanoids and their capabilities.
-   **Perception-Planning-Action Loop**: Understand the complete cycle of how robots sense, think, and act.
-   **Terminology**: A comprehensive glossary of essential robotics terms.
-   **Learning Outcomes**: Specific objectives to guide your learning through Week 1 and Week 2.
