# Learning Outcomes

## Week 1 Learning Objectives

Upon completing the first week of this chapter, you should be able to:

*   **Define Physical AI**: Understand the core differences between physical and digital AI and their respective applications.
*   **Explain Embodiment**: Articulate the concept of embodiment in AI and robotics, including its biological inspirations.
*   **Describe Sensorimotor Intelligence**: Detail how robots integrate sensory perception with motor actions to interact with the environment.
*   **Identify Key Physics Concepts**: Recognize and explain fundamental physics principles like friction, center of mass, balance, inertia, and torque as they apply to robotics.
*   **Understand Robotic Control Loops**: Describe the basics of PID control and the role of feedback loops in robotic systems.
*   **Recognize Latency Challenges**: Explain why latency is a critical factor in robotic control and how it is mitigated.

## Week 2 Learning Objectives

Upon completing the second week of this chapter, you should be able to:

*   **Analyze Humanoid Sensor Arrays**: Identify the various types of sensors used in humanoids (cameras, IMUs, LiDAR, tactile, F/T) and explain their specific functions.
*   **Compare Sensor Capabilities**: Differentiate between the strengths and weaknesses of various sensors and understand the concept of sensor fusion.
*   **Illustrate the Perception-Planning-Action Loop**: Diagram and explain the complete PPA cycle, including world modeling, planning, control, and actuation.
*   **Discuss Sim-to-Real Gap**: Understand the challenges of transferring AI policies from simulation to real-world robots and common mitigation strategies.
*   **Profile Modern Humanoids**: Describe the key features and design philosophies of leading modern humanoid robots such as Optimus, Figure 01, Unitree G1, and Agility Digit.
*   **Utilize Robotics Terminology**: Confidently use and define the common terms and concepts introduced in the glossary.
