# Learning Outcomes: Weeks 6–7

Upon successful completion of Chapter 3, students will be able to:

## Week 6: Digital Twin Fundamentals and Gazebo

*   **Define Digital Twins:** Articulate the concept of digital twins and their importance in humanoid robotics development.
*   **Understand Physics Simulation:** Explain the fundamental principles of physics engines, including gravity, collisions, friction, and rigid body dynamics.
*   **Set up Gazebo:** Install and configure the Gazebo simulation environment, including setting up necessary environment variables.
*   **Work with Gazebo Worlds and Models:** Create and launch basic Gazebo world files, and understand the role of models and plugins.
*   **Differentiate URDF and SDF:** Compare and contrast URDF and SDF robot description formats, identifying their strengths and weaknesses for different applications.
*   **Model Simple Robots:** Create basic robot descriptions using either URDF or SDF for use in simulation.

## Week 7: Advanced Simulation with Unity and HRI Visualization

*   **Simulate Humanoid Sensors:** Implement simulated LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs, understanding their respective parameters and data outputs.
*   **Design Sensor-Data Pipelines:** Conceptualize and design a basic sensor-data processing pipeline for a simulated humanoid robot.
*   **Create Unity Environments:** Set up a Unity project and construct virtual scenes for high-fidelity rendering and interaction.
*   **Render Humanoid Robots in Unity:** Import and render complex humanoid robot models in Unity, applying materials and configuring visual properties.
*   **Integrate Gazebo and Unity:** Understand methods for exchanging data between Gazebo and Unity to combine physics simulation with advanced visualization.
*   **Visualize Human-Robot Interaction:** Implement and visualize various human-robot interaction scenarios, including robot pose, sensor overlays, and perception outputs.
*   **Analyze Sim-to-Real Considerations:** Discuss the challenges and strategies for bridging the sim-to-real gap in both robot behavior and human perception.
